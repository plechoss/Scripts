### Schedule
- Finishing the funding application until the end of this week
- The actual company formation takes 4 days, next week

### Important things to note down to differentiate this from a normal work contract
- The employer doesn't specify when or where the work is conducted

### Vacation days
Three solutions typically used in practice:
- Defining the number of days of “non-performance,” or days on which the developer is free not to work and remains entitled to the full lump-sum remuneration agreed with the employer.
- Paying the developer based on the number of hours or days actually worked, not whole months.
- A gentlemen’s agreement by which the developer goes on vacation despite the absence of any contractual provisions regulating such situations.
